##### HTTP Stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol which is a web protocol that views and shares web content for user.

http is considered as a non secure protocol due to its capablity of not encrypting serfed data which makes it less secure compared to HTTPS.

#### HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure, this is a web protocol just like http but it encrypts the data which makes it much more secure and reliable.

## TLS and SSL 

transport layer security and secure socket layer are both cryptographic protocols that encrypt the connection and provide secure connection.

### TLS CERTIFICATE AND SSL CERTIFICATE ARE BOTH SAME

In order to create a secure connection server creates a symentic encryption with help of one-round-trip handshake. in which server asks for certificate/key and client responds key and make a secure encrypted connection.

>==**Server sends certificate and its key and verifies server's identity.**==
